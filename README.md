# Surfs Up

# Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of this analysis is to provide W.avy, a surfer and investor with weather data of Oahu island. You plan on opening up a surfboard and ice cream shop in Hawaii. Before W.avy decides to invest, he wants to make sure this is a feasible business. He would like to see some data that would suggest a profitable business: great weather. This includes warm temperatures and minimal precipitation. A statistical summary is pulled from Hawaii’s weather data, showing descriptions of typical June and December temperatures: [SurfsUp_Challenge.ipynb](https://github.com/nguyencao247/surfs_up/blob/main/SurfsUp_Challenge.ipynb) 

# Results: 
Below is a table of my findings for temperature data in June and December from Hawaii:
<p align="center"><img src="Resources/june_temps.png" height="400"> <img src="Resources/dec_temps.png" height="400"></p>

- Hawaii has great surfing weather all year round with a mean of 71F degrees in December and 75F degrees in June. June, of course has a higher average temperature.

- Even at its coldest, Hawaii does not get colder than 56F degrees. People could still be surfing but it’s definitely not too cold for ice cream. 56F may still be cold but it’s not too low from June’s low’s of 64F. 

- Both summaries show us that Hawaii’s temperature has an even distribution and small standard deviation (3-4), meaning that their temperature is very similar year-round. June has more temperature data reported than December (almostgit s 200 more). 

# Summary: 
The results are similar in both months, June and December. This is expected since Hawaii is in a tropical environment. There is a low distribution of results since the standard deviations are between 3-4. Both the mean and median are between 70F - 75F degrees, fantastic temperatures for surfing. Two other queries I would perform to gather more weather data for June and December would include:
1. The amount of precipitation during those months.
2. Data more specific to Oahu island, not just all of Hawaii.
